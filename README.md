# FindSummationOf2r3s
The inspiration to write this program came from one of the questions in the Putnam 2005 exam, the question is as follows:
"Show that every positive integer is a sum of one or more
numbers of the form 2r3s, where r and s are nonnegative
integers and no summand divides another. (For
example, 23 = 9 + 8 + 6.)"
I decided to take it one step further and write a function that will find the summands for a given number n.
